# About the Project

The Right Whale Portal is an open-source web application commissioned by the New England Aquarium to support research and conservation of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale. The portal brings together sightings, injury reports, entanglement cases, and population data into a single interactive platform.

Designed for researchers, managers, and the public, it provides maps, case records, and trend visualizations that make complex datasets easier to explore and understand. By presenting these insights in an accessible way, the project helps inform management decisions and raises awareness of the urgent challenges facing this species.
